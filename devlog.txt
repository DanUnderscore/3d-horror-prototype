# Version nfy.1:

nfy standing for "not fully finished"

this isnt the firstest version, but rather, the first version that has been documented with this
text file.

##### added an inventory system. 
  as in, an array where strings get appended to

##### added a "key" and a "door" system.
      When you are within the key's player checker, it appends its name to the playerinv 
      Then it queues delete itself. Then, there's the door, where if you are within its
      player checker, it looks for a key corresponding to the doors name. If it finds it,
      it erases that key from playerinv (to give the effect that you have used it), Then the
      door queue deletes itself so it "opens"

##### player able to sprint
      yay sprinting lets go
