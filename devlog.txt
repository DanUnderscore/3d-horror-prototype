nfy standing for "not fully finished"

# Version nfy.1:

this isnt the firstest version, but rather, the first version that has been documented with this
text file.

##### added an inventory system
  as in, an array where strings get appended to

##### added a "key" and a "door" system
      When you are within the key's player checker, it appends its name to the playerinv 
      Then it queues delete itself. Then, there's the door, where if you are within its
      player checker, it looks for a key corresponding to the doors name. If it finds it,
      it erases that key from playerinv (to give the effect that you have used it), Then the
      door queue deletes itself so it "opens"

##### player able to sprint
      yay sprinting lets go

# Version nfy.2:

##### player's ability to sprint has a stamina limit
      when the player is dumb and consumes all of their stamina, their stamina
      will not regen for 5 seconds. In this version though, after the 5 seconds,
      the stamina is instantly regened. I will uhh fix that in the next version. (i didnt)
      nothing to worry about when you ran out of stamina because the enemy is sluggish to
      compensate for the sprinting limit (thsi ruins the purpose of resource management??)

##### keys and doors now used in the 'debug' map
      there are also 'billboard' labels on top of the doors/keys

##### added a 'fog' effect
      its not visible in the editor though. You have to add a worldenvironment node and
      then use the 'debug_env.tres' resource

# Version nfy.3:

##### polished scripts. thats it for now

# Version nfy.4:

##### weapon with two bullet types too lazy to add description its self explanatory anyway

##### you have to click on keys/doors now to interact with them
      unlike before where you can just touch them and they do something

##### added buttons
      buttons that unlock doors just like keys. a fine addition to the door/key system
